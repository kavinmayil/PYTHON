YouTube is a popular online video sharing platform owned by Google that allows users to upload, share, and watch videos. It was founded in February 2005 by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, former employees of PayPal. YouTube has revolutionized how people consume media, interact with others, and even influence global politics, according to SMTV Sumedang. 
YouTube has evolved significantly since its inception, expanding into mobile apps and network television, and integrating with other platforms. It offers a diverse range of content, including music videos, tutorials, news, and entertainment from both individual creators (YouTubers) and established media companies. YouTube has had a profound social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and fostering the emergence of numerous successful content creators. 
While YouTube offers extensive opportunities for learning, entertainment, and connection, it has also faced criticism regarding issues such as copyright infringement, the spread of misinformation, privacy concerns, and the safety of children. Despite these challenges, YouTube continues to be a dominant force in the digital landscape, shaping the future of entertainment, communication, and information dissemination.
